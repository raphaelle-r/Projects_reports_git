# Projects_reports_git
You would find all my projects reports with open data. 

The zip folder contains collab notebook from Master project. 
report_rroty is the internship report about Stock market data clustering with a functional data approach. 

I also add the notebook containing all the functions that I implemented for my research project outlier detection for mixed data (unsupervised learning) and the paper to explain the work I did on this research. For any question or indication you can contact me on my LinkedIn page: in/raphaÃ«lle-roty/
